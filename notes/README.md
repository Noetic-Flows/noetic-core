# Notebook Hub Knowledge Base

Welcome to your local knowledge base. This system is designed to be:

1. **Local-First**: All notes are stored as Markdown files in this directory.
2. **AI-Enabled**: These files are indexed (or can be) for use with Antigravity and NotebookLM.
3. **Structured**: Use folders where appropriate, such as `architecture/` for topically grouped files.

## How to use

- Create `.md` files here.
- Tag them with keywords in YAML frontmatter for better indexing.
- Use `mcp_notebooklm` to bridge these notes with your Google NotebookLM sources.
