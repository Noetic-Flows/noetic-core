# Immediate To-Do Queue

- [ ] Review updated directory structure with `.agent/` folder (generated per suggestion by an AI) and the `notes/` folder (essentially local RAG for Antigravity agents), along with all the README.md files and relevant code structures.
- [ ] Research relevant topics for working on this project, including how to best utilize this custom local RAG system in the `notes/` folder combined with NotebookLM MCP connection, and utilize the `notes/` and NotebookLM to find and store information for use later in development. (Remember this is for AI Agents in Antigravity to utilize.)
- [x] Use your knowledge of the project and how Antigravity agents work to update `.agent/` and `GEMINI.md` for optimal AI intelligence and productivity on this project. (See `.agent/rules/core_directives.md` and `.agent/skills/`)
- [x] Update this `master_list.md` file with a plan for the next steps in development of the Noetic ecosystem monorepo.
