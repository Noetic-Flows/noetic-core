# Noetic Vision: Software 3.0

## The Core Philosophy
Noetic is built on the premise that **Software shouldn't be a script the user follows; it should be a Flow that adapts to the user's intent.** This aligns with the "Software 3.0" paradigm, where deterministic code (Software 1.0) and neural networks (Software 2.0) are orchestrated by agentic intent.

## Key Pillars

### 1. Local-First Sovereignty ("The Direct Pipe")
- **Brain-on-Device:** The core intelligence (LLM + Vector DB) runs locally. Sensitive data (emails, health) never leaves the device.
- **Optimistic UI:** Interactions are instant, assuming success locally and syncing in the background.
- **Privacy as Architecture:** We don't act as a "Middleman" proxy. The agent connects directly to local data sources (via MCP) like a "USB port for AI."

### 2. Malleable Software (Flows > Apps)
- **The "Whole Wrap":** We reject the siloed "App" model (Calendar app, Notes app, Email app). Instead, we build a **Shared Semantic Environment**.
- **Dynamic Flows:** A "Flow" is a transient application state assembled to solve a specific problem.
    - *Example:* "Plan a Trip" isn't a feature in a Travel App; it's a Flow that weaves together the Calendar, Maps, and Finance primitives.
- **Generative UI (Noetic Stage):** The interface is a "Projection" of intent. The agent "hallucinates" the UI it needs—rendering a chart, a form, or a map on the fly.

### 3. Agentic Security ("The Conscience")
- **Permission to Act:** Agents act as "Drafters," creating "Shadow Records" (e.g., a proposed calendar event) that the user must approve via a **Shadow Action Card**.
- **The Conscience Module:** An internal "Employee Handbook" that evaluates every proposed action against weighted principles (e.g., Frugality, Privacy) before execution.

## The Goal
To build a **Sovereign Agentic Environment** where intelligence, data, and logic reside entirely on the user's device, functioning as a transparent extension of the user's mind rather than a service they rent from the cloud.
